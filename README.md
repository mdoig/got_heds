# GOT Heds?
The GOT Heds? app is a simple web scraper that retrieves links to the latest *Game of Thrones* stories published by The AV Club, my personal outlet of choice for pop culture and entertainment news.

This Flask app uses BeautifulSoup to scrape its info from The AV Club's [*Game of Thrones* tag page](https://www.avclub.com/tag/game-of-thrones). I used a Jupyter notebook to trial-and-error the scraping code.

Thanks for a taking a look!
